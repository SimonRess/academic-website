  description: "Estimating causal effects is the central concern of quantitative social research. In research practice, however, only non-experimental data are often available that make causal conclusions difficult due to non-random selection and heterogeneity of individuals.
Modern causal analysis is an effective tool to address these problems and to develop solutions.
This workshop therefore first introduces its basics and discusses problems of conventional regression analysis. Based on this, in an application-oriented introduction, methods of propensity score matching (including longitudinal data as differences-from-differences propensity score matching), instrument variable estimates, regression discontinuity designs and selection correction models are presented and practiced in statistical programs."

  description: "The investigation of causal relationships often goes hand in hand with the question of the processes and mechanisms underlying these relationships and thus potential mediators. The more recent literature on causal inference shows that causal diagrams and the counterfactual conceptualization of direct and indirect causal effects are crucial tools for making transparent the conditions under which causal mediation analysis allows valid conclusions about direct and indirect effects. Procedures that provide information on how strongly the results can be influenced by violating individual assumptions regarding content are also dealt with (i.e., sensitivity analysis)."

  description: "This course uses causal graphs as a remarkably simple, yet general and powerful framework to describe and discuss a large set of problems that empirical social scientists need to tackle. How can I communicate my assumptions effectively to others, and can I test them? How can I tell correlation from causation? How do I choose control variables for my regression models? After discussing how DAGs can be used to answer these foundational questions, the course also covers basics of causal mediation, instrumental variables, nonresponse/selection bias (and adjustments for it), and panel data analysis from a 'graphical' perspective."

  description: "Data Science is the interdisciplinary science of the extraction of interpretable and useful knowledge from potentially large datasets. Due to the rapid surge of digital trace data (often as “Big Data”) in a wide range of application areas, Data Science is also increasingly utilized in the social sciences and humanities. In contrast to empirical social science, Data Science methods often serve purposes of exploration and inductive inference. In this course, we aim to provide an introduction into Data Science for practitioners. In particular, we want to impart basic understanding of the main methods and algorithms and understand how these can be deployed in practical application scenarios, focusing on the analysis of digital behavioral data found on the Web. We cover aspects of data collection, preprocessing, exploration, visualization and machine learning using basic Python and key packages like pandas, numpy and scikit- learn."
