#One way we could make this different is to present the places of teaching as a smaller list with a click through to course descriptions and why we were teaching at that location. More in line with the project presentation line of reasoning. If we did each teaching engagement independently like a talk, and then aggregate them, then we could use schema.org metadata to describe each teaching engagement.

#TO DO
#Each workshop should be broken down into its own page and aggregated like a publication. The workshop archtype needs to be set, as one is not in there yet. If there are any problems with aggregation look at the workshop template widget and make sure the workshops are set to publication type 7.
