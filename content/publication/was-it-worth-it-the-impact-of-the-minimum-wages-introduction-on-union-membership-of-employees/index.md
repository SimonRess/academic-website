abstract: This contribution scrutinises how introducing a statutory minimum wage
  of EUR 8.50 per hour on January 1, 2015, impacted German employees’ decision
  towards a union membership. Based on representative data from the ‘Panel
  Labour Market and Social Security’, we apply a logistic
  difference-in-differences propensity score matching approach on entries in and
  withdrawals from unions in the German Trade Union Confederation (Deutscher
  Gewerkschaftsbund, DGB). Our results show no separate effect on withdrawals
  from or entries in unions by the minimum wage introduction for those employees
  who benefited financially from it, but a significant increase of entries
  overall. Thus, unions’ campaign for a minimum wage strengthened their position
  in total but did not reverse the segmentation of union membership patterns.
